# RosettaProjects

Welcome to RosettaProjects! This is an organization dedicated to providing something similar to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) and [Hyperpolyglot](https://hyperpolyglot.org/), but rather than snippets or single-file solutions, the basic unit here is entire, self-contained projects that contain everything required to build and/or execute the code they contain.

Additionally, this project also provides templates for use with the excellent [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tools, dockerfiles, nix scripts (flakes and shell.nix), guix scripts, and other scripts aiming to facilitate the process of setting up a developer environment on any suitable machine.

Why the focus on projects? In part, because this helps to instill a sense of patterns and best practices for a given language (and, to an extent, in general). Another reason is that learning any language necessitates learning boilerplate, like it or not. Finally, most real-world software development involves multiple files, and a developer needs to understand not just the syntax of the language, but also how the various files interact and what is typically located where.

How did we choose the projects? They should be relatively small and self-contained, and with the exception of the "Hello, World!" projects, they should also be interesting, perhaps even useful. Collectively, they should cover most aspects of programming and should be complex enough that languages can showcase their salient features, as well as their relative shortcomings.

 ## Constituent projects by category

 * [programming-language-table](https://github.com/RosettaProjects/programming-language-table)

   

   This is a side-by-side, feature-by-feature comparison of programming languages, where both the programming languages and the features can be selected and ordered and their appearance customized. The source is kept in Markdown and synchronized between per-language and per-feature formats. The site is generated by a bespoke custom site generator written in `TBD`. The website is [here]().
  
* [rosetta-project-utils](https://github.com/RosettaProjects/rosetta-projects-utils)

  This is a collection of tools and scripts that may be used to develop, build, test, and run the projects here.

* Project Templates

  Templates are provided for use with [copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/) or [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/). If running without [Nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/), installation with [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is recommended.

* Code Projects

  Self-contained projects in various languages, all conforming to the same specification. Designed to make comparison between languages easier and to serve as a kind of 'Rosetta Stone' for programming languages.
